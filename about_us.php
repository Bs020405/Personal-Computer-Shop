                <strong>PCS</strong> is your one-stop-shop for the latest and greatest in the PC market.
                We at <strong>PCS</strong> are a humble establishment based in Vadodara started by 4 amateurs established in the year 1995.
                We took a bold step to venture into the online space in the year 2020.
                Yes, we know some people consider this year as unlucky but it turned out to be a blessing for us.
                The Decision to go online meant that we were among the few businesses that could stay open (online)
                during the pandemic. In fact, we managed to grow manifolds since we started out online.
                And for that, we express our utmost gratitude to our customers.
